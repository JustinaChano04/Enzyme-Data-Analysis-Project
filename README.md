# Enzyme-Data-Analysis-Project
This project was created to analyze NaturalCatalyst's old enzyme data to use towards finding a new optimal enzyme with an emphasis on performance and speed. The M2 file determines the velocity and enzyme reaction rate of the enzymes. M3 focuses on the algorithm we created in determining the parameters for a the NextGen enzymes. In M4, the data is visualized to show which NextGen enzyme performs best under various conditions given.
